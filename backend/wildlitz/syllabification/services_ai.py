    - Separate with hyphens

    - Must be real English words
    - Should rhyme with "{word}"
    - Use simple, kid-friendly words
    - Age-appropriate (no complex or inappropriate words)

    3. SOUND EXPLANATIONS:
    - One explanation per phoneme in the phonetic breakdown
    - Format: "As in the [first/middle/last] sound of [example word]"
    - Use common, simple example words
